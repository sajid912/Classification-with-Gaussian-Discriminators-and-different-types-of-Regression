# Classification-with-Gaussian-Discriminators-and-different-types-of-Regression

In this project, we classify the data with different methods like Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Linear, Non-linear, Ridge regression with and without intercept and compare their performances. Essentially we predict the labels of output, find mean square error and try to minimize it in each case. When minimization becomes difficult, we use Gradient descent method to directly minimize the loss.

The report discusses about various performance trade offs and it can be concluded that Ridge regression with Gradient descent has the lowest value of MSE for Testing data. Contrarily, OLE regression with Intercept has the lowest MSR for Training data.
